                        <p>Among the most popular of all cookie types, the chocolate chip cookie's invention was a happy
                            accident.</p>
                        <p>In 1930 Ruth Graves Wakefield ran out of baker's chocolate and substituted for it with pieces
                            of Nestle's® semi-sweet chocolate. The rest is history. Chocolate chip cookies are drop
                            cookies that can be soft and doughy or crisp and crunchy depending on how long you cook them
                            or what ingredients you use.</p>

                        <p>The history of chocolate can be traced back more than 3,000 years to the Maya, Toltec, and
                            Aztec people who prepared a beverage from the fruit of the cocoa bean.</p>
                        <p>The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred,
                            and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.</p>

                        <p>Ancient Egyptians were the first to enjoy a gooey treat now called marshmallow as early as
                            2000 BC. </p>
                        <p>The treat was considered very special and it was reserved for gods and royalty. Marshmallow
                            was made from the mallow plant (Athaea officinalis) that grows wild in marshes.</p>

                        <p>The first incarnation of the lollipop was probably created by cave people thousands of years
                            ago who collected honey from beehives with a stick. </p>
                        <p>Not wanting to waste the sweet nectar, they most likely licked the stick, thus inventing the
                            world’s first lollipop. Archaeologists believe that ancient Chinese, Arabs, and Egyptians
                            all produced fruit and nut confections that they "candied" in honey, which serves as a
                            preservative, and inserted sticks into to make easier to eat.</p>

                        <p>The story of baklava began long long ago, as a matter of fact one version of the story claims
                            that Baklava origins to the mighty Assyrians, who had been preparing it ancient-assyriaas
                            early as the 8th century B.C. by layering unleavened flat bread with chopped nuts in
                            between, drenching it in honey and then baking it in primitive wood-burning ovens.</p>
                        <p>The modern day baklava went through a number of transitions as the history of the area kept
                            on changing. Middle East, Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans, Caucasia; Turks, Arabs, Jews,
                            Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians of today who introduce baklava as their national dessert were
                            all part of the Ottoman empire once.</p>
